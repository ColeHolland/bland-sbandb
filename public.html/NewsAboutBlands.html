        <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:arial,sans-serif;">Painted over white walls with tan color......... Yep.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:arial,sans-serif;">Each location now has new bed sheets that are made of silk to make your overnight stay the best you have had your entire life. And if that doesn't catch your attention, we now also have tempur-pedic pillows that make head and neck feel amazing after a long day.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size:28px; font-family:arial,sans-serif;">Coming soon, Bland's will be opening two new locations to support our customer's needs. The first location that has been decided upon is the beautiful island of Hawaii off the beach that looks out over the open ocean. Due to planning errors though, the second location has not been decided upon at this time. Be sure to stay tuned and find out where this location may be so you can prepare yourself for a relaxing get away.</p>
