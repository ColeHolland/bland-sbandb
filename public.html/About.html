        <p> Bland’s Bed and Breakfast has been a bed and breakfast service for 50 years, hence the name Bland’s.  With a color scheme that gives you a sense of
        calm and relaxation, Bland’s is the perfect place for you and your loved ones to get away from the outside world. We provide rooms that go from 1-3 
        beds and vary in separate prices from each other. Bland’s rooms have been given some of the most middle of the road ratings from critics all across the
        United States. For more information on this topic click on the link on the top of the page. </p>
        
        <p> Alongside the average rooms and room service, Bland’s prides itself and giving our tenants an excellent experience in the breakfast portion as
        well. With a kitchen staff of locally raised chefs, Bland’s provide you with food that will knock your socks off and leave you wanting more. The 
        thing that makes us unique from every other bed and breakfast is that we give you your food without any toppings or seasonings and let you make the 
        decisions on how personalized you want your breakfast to be. This allows the consumer to get exactly what they want, stay away from things they 
        absolutely find atrocious, and keeps the chances of food born allergies at an all-time low. </p>
        
        <p> Overall Bland’s is an average bed and breakfast service that makes people feel both happy they stayed and wondering if they ever came. Bland’s
        may only have 2.5 out of 5 stars, but we boast those stars strongly above our heads and make sure that every tenant we have is given the best
        experience that we can provide them.</p>
