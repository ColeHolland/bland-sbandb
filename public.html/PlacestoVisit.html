        <p> Bland’s Bed and Breakfast has some very interesting places to visit around one of our main locations in Indianola, Iowa. One of the main things to
        do when you visit Bland’s is to schedule a visit around the Indianola Balloon Classic. The Balloon Classic brings thousands of people to the city of
        Indianola each summer and displays a great amount of colorful balloons that cover the evening and night sky. Each year Bland’s has their very own hot
        air balloon that they have flying in the classic, the best way to figure out which one is ours is to look for the white balloon with the beige writing
        on it. </p>

        <p> Along with the short lived Balloon Classic Bland’s is also located decently close to the capital city of Iowa, Des Moines. With Indianola only being
        a short 20-30 minute drive away from Des Moines, families can easily take a trip to the capital city to go shopping, sightseeing, or just to have a
        night on the town. And with the rapidly growing size of Des Moines, you can find plenty to do by yourself or even as a family.</p>

        <p> A final thing that Bland’s is conveniently located next to is Simpson College. Simpson College is a private college located right smack dab in
        the middle of the city of Indianola. With attendance not being as high as some of the other public colleges in the state, Simpson can provide a much
        greater experience to its students and also the community around. So the next time you stop by Bland’s Bed and Breakfast make sure to check onto
        Simpson’s website and see if they are offering anything open to the public at that point in time. </p>
